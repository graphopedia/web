The nested shapes are typically aligned either at their bottom edge or in the lower left corner. The nesting tends to negatively impact the chart's readability. At the same time, the chart becomes more compact. Although it is difficult to extract precise values from this chart for a reader, when accompanied by values written out next to shapes, this chart variation can be useful.
